"Mr. President, once again, Governor Corbett has a short memory. Since his budget announcement back in February, the Governor has said that we have to hold the line on spending. Not only that, he said that this would be a new age of open, transparent government, like never before. He said that we were able to make some significant cuts during the last cycle, but more cuts were going to be needed to get us back on the road to fiscal responsibility.
Interest groups such as college students were told that there was not enough money to appropriately fund their universities or to fund their PHEAA grants. Those with pre-existing health con-ditions were told there was not any money to continue to fund the adultBasic health insurance program so that they could receive adequate coverage. The disabled and the elderly were told that while their causes may be worthy, there just was not any room at the inn.
Miraculously, however, Mr. President, it appears that money may be found to give Shell Oil Corporation a $67 million annual tax credit for just a short time, 25 years, Mr. President. Who could use a multibillion dollar tax credit more than Shell Oil? I could think of a few people. You know, we could fund the afore-mentioned adultBasic insurance program with just one year's tax credit. I cannot say that it would create any new jobs, but I think the 44,000 people who have already been thrown to the curb, if we continued the program, they might be healthy enough or alive to be able to at least work in these jobs.
Much like the proven litigator that he is, the details are being held very close to the vest, and it is not until you peel away the benign-looking Tax Code bill that the devilish details appear. For the next quarter century, Pennsylvania taxpayers, according to the plan, will be giving Shell close to $1.7 billion in tax credits to bring its ballyhooed ethane cracker plant and the jobs to Pennsylvania."
"In the recent 10 days, it has been uncovered that the Governor has been negotiating, somewhat clandestinely and secretly, with Royal Dutch Shell to bring an ethane cracker plant to southwestern Pennsylvania. Supposedly, and I have heard this song before, we are going to let them basically get off beyond scot-free, with an almost $2 billion tax giveaway over 25 years, so that we are going to lock down the people of Pennsylvania for a quarter of a century into this obligation. At the same time, this same cracker plant is located in a KOZ, which means they will not owe any taxes anyway for a decade.
In the meantime, the folks out there, the little people, which is by far the majority of the people, it used to be people in the lower class, now it is pretty much the whole class, unless you are in the elite upper class, nobody is going to give you a tax give-away. But apparently, the Governor thinks it is a good idea, once again, to secretly try to make a deal with this huge international gas conglomerate to get obligated for all kinds of tax privileges. Essentially, at the end of the day, Pennsylvanians are going to owe this company about $7,000 apiece, and they are guarantee-ing us something between 10,000 and 20,000 jobs. But I will tell you what, Mr. President, there is no way I am going to vote for any kind of legislation, and I do not think anyone in this body should, until we get a guaranteed number of jobs. The tax credit should be based on the number of jobs guaranteed for Pennsylva-nians. I have seen the most recent studies that show that many of these jobs can be held, if in fact we create 10,000 to 20,000 jobs, and I am weary of that number, that these jobs can go to people in Ohio, they can go to people in West Virginia, and I want peo-ple in West Virginia and Ohio to have jobs, but first, Mr. Presi-dent, I want Pennsylvanians to have a shot at these jobs.
So let us be sensible about this. Let us get it out in the open, and I know now we are running to catch up. I think the Governor sees, the legislature should know what is going on. He wants to vote this thing and fast-track it, which I think is terrible policy. We consider legislation around here that takes us months, years, and sometimes multiple years and hearings to determine the best way to pursue it. Now, we have not had a single hearing. We are finding out third-hand what is going on, and now, apparently, the Governor is going to let us in on a few things. Now, he wants us to pass it before the end of this budget cycle. There is no way we should fast-track something that is going to affect Pennsylvani-ans for a quarter of a century, that is going to be the biggest tax giveaway in the history of this country, and I think that Pennsyl-vanians have a right to know what is going on."
"I mentioned
we are now speeding forward to pass the State budget on time,
and some folks may have heard about another issue that is looming
out there that I cannot believe we are actually going to vote
on this week. We are going to vote on one of the biggest issues
this State has seen in probably 100 years, and that is the issue of
the huge tax giveaway to Royal Dutch Shell. As folks might
remember, the media uncovered that Governor Corbett was secretly
negotiating with Royal Dutch Shell. I do not even like the
sound of this, Royal Dutch Shell. The aforementioned company
has record profits in the billions of dollars. They are a company
that is already present here in Pennsylvania with Marcellus
Shale. They are a key player there. That is before we have even
settled the problem of this issue with pollution in hydraulic fracking, the process used in Marcellus Shale. So we have the
issue of fracking. Now, apparently, we have an issue with an
ethane cracker coming into the same region. So we have
fracking, and we are going to have cracking, and as far as people's
right to talk about this stuff and be involved, the man and
woman and child who are just trying to get by, as for your rights
to discuss this, that is going to be sacked. So we are going to be
fracking, cracking, and sacking here in Pennsylvania.
I have talked about this, the idea that we can, in a knowing
way, give away nearly $2 billion over a quarter of a century.
That is what Governor Corbett wants to do. That is what this
legislation will do. It will bind Pennsylvanians for 25 years to
give $2 billion in tax credits to Royal Dutch Shell because they
have said they may be able to create 10,000 or 20,000 jobs, but
they have not said that they can guarantee they are in Pennsylvania.
Actually, they have not really even said that they can create
10,000 or 20,000 jobs. In fact, most of the people--the only thing
they have said, and the Tribune out of Pittsburgh pointed this out,
they talked about 400 to 600 jobs. That is all they are talking
about right now.
The bottom line is, we do not have all the information. Mr.
President, we in our Caucus had a chance to be visited by DCED
Secretary Walker and Revenue Secretary Meuser yesterday. I
like both of those gentlemen. I think they are both smart guys. I
think they are both good gentlemen and do the best that they can.
We asked them a lot of questions, the Members of the Democratic
Caucus, about the commitment to jobs, what exactly happens
with these tax credits. By the way, when I say tax credits,
ladies and gentlemen, you should know, Pennsylvanians, what
this means in sheer math is you give $7,000 of your money to
Royal Dutch Shell. You give them the money. It gets taken from
you so that they can maybe create some jobs. You should have
a chance to ask some questions yourself. My guess is, you will
not. That is why guys like me are here, to try to ask those questions
for you.
So we are going to, in addition to the budget, vote on a little
piece binding Pennsylvanians for a quarter of a century, we are
going to vote on that this week. We have not even had a hearing.
We, 20 Members of the Democratic Caucus, met with these Secretaries.
They told us they still could not answer the questions we
were asking because negotiations are still going on. We are apparently
afraid that if we do not win this deal, if we do not give
$2 billion over 25 years, that Royal Dutch Shell, the record-
profiting international oil and gas company, will go to West
Virginia or Ohio. So we are afraid that Ohio or West Virginia is
going to give them a better deal. Mr. President, if Ohio and West
Virginia wants to give them more than $2 billion in tax credits,
more of your money to get them to go there with a faint promise
that is uncommitted to create more jobs, maybe we should consider
letting them do it.
In the meantime, we have many questions that have to be
asked. What happens if Royal Dutch Shell comes here for
10 years, they get their agreement for 25 years of tax credits,
then they decide to leave? Can they take their tax credits with
them? I fear the answer to that question, Mr. President. I think
most people are not aware of what these tax credits are. We have
it with the film tax credit industry. A movie company can come
here and be given 10 years of tax credits. If they leave after a
year or two, or if they do not need the tax credits, they can hold
on to these tax credits and sell them to other companies, and they do not even have to be film companies. The same thing, I believe,
can be done with Royal Dutch Shell. We give them our
money, they can sell it to someone else. This is incredible.
Mr. President, at a time when people are trying to pay their
bills just to stay in their houses, they are worried about holding
onto their own jobs, they are worried about their own future and
the future of their families to get an education and have a shot in
Pennsylvania, we are talking about the biggest cash giveaway in
the history of this State, and we have not even had a single hearing,
let alone a public hearing.
Mr. President, I cannot see any way how I can support such
a wrongheaded piece of legislation. I have a long track record of
supporting economic growth and job creation in this State, but
my job here is to ask the questions, certainly ask the tough questions,
but the easy questions have not even been asked yet. So I
cannot see any way that I could vote for this huge tax giveaway.
I know there is no way I can let the most vulnerable people of
Pennsylvania who are getting hit terribly hard in this budget, at
the same time we are talking about taking care of the super,
super rich, I do not see how I can vote for the budget."
"We have an opportunity today,
an opportunity that may never come again. What we have
before us today is an opportunity to pass a bill that means thousands
of jobs for Pennsylvanians all across the State. This bill
provides a performance-based tax credit that will be used for
purchasing ethane and for using ethylene-manufactured goods.
We have the ability, by passing this bill, to stand up for jobs in
the Commonwealth, good-paying jobs, jobs that will sustain
families by providing a lifeline to communities all across the
State who have suffered as a result of the steel mills closing
down years ago.
In mid-March, Shell Chemical announced that it signed a land
option agreement to potentially build a $4 billion ethane cracker
plant in Beaver County, located in my district. They did not say
they would build the plant, they said they would potentially build
the plant. This bill will help seal the deal. The tax credit before
us will say to Shell, we want you to come, and we want the jobs
you are bringing with you. The Shell project will be the largest
economic development project in southwestern Pennsylvania in
more than a decade. Ever since taking office, Mr. President, my
number-one obligation to the people who elected me was to work
hard to bring jobs to my district, and now, Mr. President, we
have an opportunity to do that just that, by passing this legislation
which provides for the resource manufacturing tax credit.
The tax credit means jobs for the people of my district and
jobs for the people of Pennsylvania. We have a once-ina-
lifetime opportunity that will allow us to transform Pennsylvania
back into the manufacturing powerhouse it once was. The
construction of an ethane cracking facility in my district would
create upwards of 10,000 jobs, and thousands of spinoff jobs for
related industries that will spring up in the vicinity of the plant
and across Pennsylvania to avail themselves of inexpensive and
plentiful raw materials that will be transformed into many of the
products we use every day - pool liners, trash bags, sealants,
carpet backing, insulation, detergent, food packaging, bottles,
footwear, clothing, and the list goes on and on.
If you travel around the country, you will inevitably meet a lot
of people who used to be from Pennsylvania. When the mills
closed down, they left. This bill provides us an opportunity to
bring those people back. I stand before you today to ask for your
support. This bill means jobs, jobs, jobs. This is not a tax credit
bill, this is a jobs bill. Let us rebuild Pennsylvania together. I ask
that you all stand with me and support the hardworking families
of Pennsylvania."

"Mr. President, my district is as far away as
any from the prospective site of the ethane refinery, so the natural
assumption is the chances of economic benefits working their
way into our area are pretty remote. But it turns out that this
project is a winner for just about every part of Pennsylvania.
In northeastern Pennsylvania, there are dozens of plastic manufacturers,
nearly 40 in Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties
alone, who now must bring raw material down from Canada or
up from the Gulf of Mexico. Being able to acquire it from just
across the State cuts shipping costs and time. A firm that can cut
costs becomes more competitive on the prices for its products, and more demand means more direct and indirect jobs. One of
the companies standing to benefit in this fashion is Procter &
Gamble. Located in Mehoopany, Wyoming County, P&G employs
more than 4,000 direct and indirect workers in every senatorial
district within a six-county radius. So when you think
about it, citizens who live in Senator Gordner's district, Senator
Blake's district, Senator Yudichak's district, and Senator Yaw's
district all work at the P&G plant in my district. It is an economic
engine in our region contributing to the local economy,
helping families buy homes, send their kids to college, investing
in our communities through the United Way, and other charitable
giving.
The plant has already saved money by powering its operations
with its own natural gas wells, 10 billion cubic feet of gas a year
no longer piped 1,500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. The plant,
having the ethylene for Pampers and other products closer to
home, adds to the savings, positioning them to expand and create
even more jobs.
Another example is the PepsiCo company plant in Mountain
Top. It is a production plant in Luzerne County, also in my Senatorial
district which produces Gatorade for distribution throughout
the entire northeastern United States. Recently, a bottle manufacturer
co-located next door to this facility to improve efficiency
in costs. Companies are more likely to expand profitable,
competitive, productive locations, and these two regional employers
are better positioned and better poised for future growth
and future viability.
Over the years we have seen multiple economic strategies
launched in countless incentives and assistance programs offered
to jump start job creation. Few have had any hope of yielding the
immense economic payoff anticipated for this project. So we can
act decisively to insure a better economic future for all of Pennsylvania.
I urge an affirmative vote."
"Senator Vogel, to his credit, and
others have talked about what would be the best way to provide
that credit over the life of the next 20-plus years. I think it is a
prudent investment. I have been in office 25 years. When I first
was elected, I was looking at a steel mill in South Side on Second
Avenue. It has taken six mayors to transform the economic
development, the business, and the vibrancy of the city of Pittsburgh.
It has happened over a long period of time. This so-called
cracker plant may begin with the initiative here today in the Senate
and the House and with this Governor, but the timeline is
probably going to be extensive and could go into some future
administration.
I do think we need to start the clock ticking, provide the economic
developmental tool to this Governor in a nonpartisan fashion
so that there could be appropriate, constructive, and prudent
negotiations with Royal Dutch Shell and what this economic
opportunity means. That discussion and that arsenal of an opportunity
and the arsenal of the tool box for economic development
needs to be in place now. I know there are people who are commenting,
why are we doing this now? We are talking about a
plant and a decision that has not even been made yet and may not
be made for several years. But that process begins now and it needs to begin in earnest. I certainly do support and differentiate
the non-wisdom of Act 13 versus what I do consider a prudent
and appropriate investment for a tremendous amount of economic
development.
I will close with just one reminder. I will not start naming
every project, but in the time I have been here in the Senate, we
have, through public subsidy or through bond indebtedness, subsidized
over $5 billion, with a ""b,"" $5 billion of economic investment.
So the $1.4 billion as proposed, or whatever it ends up
being, is really not inconsistent with all the other energies that
have come before us."
"Mr. President, I am not going to speak for a long time. I appreciate what many of the Members are talking about. I just have to say that frankly, as a Member of the Pennsylvania Senate, elected by and representing about 280,000 people, I feel I have a duty to be as informed as I possibly can be on something this monumental, significant, and long-term in this State. Frankly, Mr. President, I do not know all that much more about what we are trying to do here with regard to the Tax Code and the ethane cracker plant than I knew a couple of weeks ago when I first saw this story from Pete DeCoursey on Capitolwire that uncovered the fact that Governor Corbett was conducting negotiations on this issue.
I know as we have gone forward with this, my friends and colleagues on the other side also felt they needed a lot more information both in the House and Senate, and folks have hustled in the whirlwind that we go through when we are trying to pass a budget to get all the information possible. All I can tell you is that I have supported tax credits in the past with the film tax credit. I am supportive of trying to encourage businesses to come here and invest in Pennsylvania, but usually, there has to be a very tight verification of what the deal is. What is the business offering, what is the Commonwealth offering, and what are the verifications for performance? That also goes with this whole concept of reform that many of us have been championing these last several years here. The whole concept of openness, transpar-ency, making sure that the taxpayers and the people across the State know what we are doing, how we are doing it, and why we are doing it. That is an important issue in this State, and on this issue I do not believe we are coming even close to becoming open or transparent.
So my problem with this legislation is not with its intent. It is with the fact that the information available is not to the level that I think any taxpayer at home would want me to have in order to vote for a piece of legislation which proposes to bind the Com-monwealth for a quarter century. I have heard many different promises with regard to jobs. And you have to be careful about promises in the legislature or in business, and you have to verify. But I have heard anything from 400 jobs, to 10,000 jobs, to 20,000 jobs, to more, to less. I have not seen anything that certi-fies that those jobs will be Pennsylvania jobs, certifies that those will be quality jobs, life-fulfilling, economy-sustaining jobs. And I am not satisfied that Royal Dutch Shell will be held to a stan-dard where they must stay in Pennsylvania and carry out what-ever proposed obligations we are putting on them.
I believe in jobs, and I believe that you make a pact with busi-nesses to bring jobs to Pennsylvania. But when you cannot verify exactly how many jobs we are talking about, yet on the other side of the relationship, a business gets to verify what their tax package will look like but we do not really know what we will get, that is an unfair deal. That is not a good deal for the people of Pennsylvania. So until I get more information, until I really feel that we are going to get those jobs, that the people of Penn-sylvania really are going to benefit, I cannot support this legislation, Mr. President."
"Mr. President, let me start out with a very simple premise. Governments do not create economy, govern-ments enable economies. That is called tax policies. Government does not have a product or service to sell. We do not make any money by ourselves, and the only way we get any money is when we tax somebody, whether it is a business or an individual. So, it is incumbent on us to envision methodologies, programs, and ideas that we can, as a State, make investments toward so that the private sector can bring us new taxable economy. That is what this cracker deal is all about. It is about bringing new jobs, it is about bringing new economy to the State.
When I look around my area, and I live in Montgomery County, I think back to all the companies that used to be there: Bethlehem Steel, United States Steel, Firestone Tire, Kiwi shoe polish, Mrs. Smith's Pies, and Mayer Pollock, who, by the way, erected the Golden Gate Bridge for Bethlehem Steel. We had great economic power in our State at one time. We do not today. We are suffering, we are suffering dramatically, and we have a chance here to bring new jobs to our State. We want to somehow politicize this. It is inappropriate to do that. We are hurting all of our citizens when we do that.
I heard an argument earlier about a very parochial attitude toward this development. What is this going to do in my district?Let me tell you what it is going to do in everybody's district. It is going to improve our economy for all of us. If you are worried about deliverables from State government today as new funding or funding in existing programs, you are going to want more taxable income in your district. If you want to see the govern-ment expand its spending, you are going to want more economy in the State that can be taxed. That is what the cracker plant will do. But, it is not only about one plant being developed by Shell. We are talking about tens of thousands of jobs that will be created upstream in the oil fields and downstream in the manufac-turing, distribution, and the sales of these products. It is an in-credible opportunity for our State and it is one very worthwhile for us to invest behind.
To go back to what I said before, we do not sell a product, and we do not sell a service. To get a dollar, we need to tax some-body, and the best solution is to bring more taxable money and more taxable individuals into our State. Take people off of unem-ployment and give them new jobs, bring more citizens into this State, if that is what is necessary. Let us expand our economy and we can expand the positive welfare of all of the people within our State.
This is not just about my district. This is about Pennsylvania not needing to be competitive district to district or county to county. We do not even need to be competitive State to State. We need to be competitive with the international market. Penn-sylvania has the highest, the highest corporate net income tax structure in the world. Pennsylvania used to be second to Japan. Japan lowered their corporate net income rate in February. We now stand alone as having the single highest corporate net in-come tax rate, and we have the highest corporate tax structure with the single sales factor, which hopefully we fix with net op-erating loss carryforwards limited, with capital stock and fran-chise tax, and with a corporate net income. We have the highest structure in the United States, in the world, and we disincentivize businesses from coming here. We now have an administration with an initiative to bring these jobs back to Pennsylvania, bring jobs back to Pennsylvania. This is an incredibly worthwhile investment by the State, and I stand in full support of House Bill No. 761."
"Senator BOSCOLA. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate for about 13 years now, and in the House for 4 years, and one of the things that I consistently said was that we need to make things in this country and this State, that manufacturing is impor-tant, and it resinates with people because, as you talk to individu-als across the State, you will see that people say, what are we making here in this State? Are we becoming a service-oriented economy? If that is the case, we are not going to have the good-paying jobs out there, and we are not going to be able to compete globally. So when I saw this bill, and actually learned more about it, I thought, well, let us get into the details, and let us see what this manufacturing tax credit is really going to do.
This credit for Shell to build a chemical ethane cracker plant is a huge investment, some might say a huge risk. But with huge risks come huge rewards. I was a little cautious when I first heard about the language, but became more confident as I read more and more about this tax credit and about the Shell com-pany, knowing that they probably would build a state-of-the-art facility. And why this is important to me, Mr. President, is be-cause I grew up as a steelworker's daughter. I grew up in the city of Bethlehem where Bethlehem Steel was, where most of the people worked in the city of Bethlehem and the Lehigh Valley. And I will tell you what, it was a robust town, men and women working very hard, proud of what they were doing by making steel and building this country.
Now, Bethlehem Steel is no longer around, but I can tell you that some of those men and women actually worked so hard to put their sons and daughters through college. That is kind of what I wanted to say today was, my father, a steelworker, when he was in high school, he actually got straight A's in practically every class he was involved with. And sometimes they would give him a 0 because, especially in math, he would never get a single problem wrong. He applied to Lehigh University, but be-cause his family had no money, he could not attend. My father worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant with a good, solid-paying job, and he made sure that his daughter, if she was smart enough, would never be denied college because he could not afford it. Well, I went to Villanova University and got a master's degree, and now I am a Senator. So what does that say?
Anyway, the whole point of this story is, we have an opportu-nity today with the biggest manufacturing tax credit I have ever seen, it is going to bring good-paying jobs to this Common-wealth. What about those families? Maybe there is going to be a child  or  two  whose  family  never  went to college and one is going to be able to go now. The families are going to be happy. This State is finally going to become on record as one of the biggest job creators as compared to other States. That is fascinat-ing, and I am enthusiastic about this, and I hope it works out. I know it will. When all those jobs are created, I probably will be one saying to the naysayers that I told you so.
Mr. President, I just want to say enthusiastically that, I think, this is one of the best pieces of legislation I have seen. I am proud to be part of the Senate today."

"Mr. President, I am excited to support this tax bill. As with the Tax Code or any code bill, there are things in it for people to love and for people to hate. But in this one, the tax incentives for the new Shell cracker plant in western Pennsylvania are one of the most exciting things I have seen in my 16 years in this body. It is a game changer for Pennsylvania today, tomorrow, and for my grandchildren. I ran again this time because of the Marcellus Shale opportunities. It is huge. It turns Pennsylvania into an energy exporting State once again. I come from an area where, 150 years ago, we were the oil and gas capi-tal of the world. Today we are not, but the advent of the wet gas, particularly, the gas in western Pennsylvania, is transforming my communities.
The big issue for this cracker plant, frankly, when they made the decision to come here, I was talking to an executive of a company who has four cracker plants all down in the Gulf Coast, and she--the president of the company is female--said to me she was interested that they were going to build a cracker plant away from the refining complexes. Well, of course the reason is obvious: there are other uses for this gas as a feedstock for innumera-ble businesses, as Senator Baker pointed out. They are putting it up in the center of the area where this gas is being produced, and their big concern is that there is enough of this gas to sustain this plant for years into the future. That is what we are talking about here, Mr. President, the future.
This is, as I said, a game changer, a global change in Pennsyl-vania's future economy. I am excited to support it, not just pleased to. When Senator Baker pointed out, correctly, that the--this is a new industry here, not just a new business or factory, and this will benefit every manufacturer in the State. I urge its support. Thank you."
"Mr. President, very briefly, I was not going to rise, but I heard the comments of my good friend from Beaver County who started off the discussion tonight, and I heard him say something along the lines that we have a unique opportunity; an opportunity today to create jobs and create devel-opment, and to move Pennsylvania forward; an opportunity to really do something here in this Chamber, do something that we were sent here to do for the people we represent. I thought about that. Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that we had that opportunity many, many times in this building, many times on this floor. We had that opportunity last year when the Senate Democrats wrote out a plan known as PA Works. We had it again this year when we rolled out plan, after plan, after plan that talked about ways that Pennsylvania can move forward with no tax increases, no expenses to our citizens, and to quote what one of the earlier speakers said, allow government to enable econ-omy.
Mr. President, government can enable the economy in many ways. It can enable the economy by giving huge tax breaks and incentives to the cracker plant, which I am going to be support-ing today because I believe in this program. But let us not kid ourselves, Mr. President, there are many ways to create jobs, and there are many ways that government can enable an economy. Here is a secret that maybe a lot of people do not want to admit: Not all those ideas come from one side of the aisle. Sometimes those types of ideas come from this side of the aisle. Would it not be great if we could work in a bipartisan way to do exactly what the gentlemen from Beaver, Bucks, and multiple other counties characterized as government enabling the economy? Would it not be great if we could work together on many different ideas to do just exactly that?
So there is going to be a lot of support on both sides of the aisle for this because we believe in it, we believe it is good for Pennsylvania, but do not kid yourself, Mr. President, do not kid yourself. Many opportunities arise in this room. Many opportuni-ties arise in this room for job creation, for job development, and to move Pennsylvania forward. This is one of them, and there have been many, many, many others. I hope when we return in the fall, and as we look forward to our next budgetary process, that when this side of the aisle comes forth with those kinds of ideas, I hope there is the willingness and the eagerness to support those with the same type of willingness and eagerness that you see on this side of the aisle to support this."
"Mr. President, I appreciate the opportu-nity to speak on this. You know, most folks who are listening to this back at home or when I try to explain it really do not under-stand how complex budgeting is here in the State Capitol. They think there is one big budget bill and we vote on it and then that is the end of it, but in reality, that is not the case. Of course here we are discussing House Bill No. 761, which is the Tax Code. Also, it has very key and important parts in our budget that we really must consider very carefully.
This bill, perhaps as its centerpiece, has the tax credit for the plant which will utilize the natural gas we are extracting through-out Pennsylvania and use it to make it into very valuable compo-nents that we can use in manufacturing. In fact, some of that manufacturing occurs in my district too. But even if it did not, I would be in support of this. I really want to be careful to say that I do not want to be parochial about this, I care about all Pennsyl-vanians. I want everybody to have a good job, if possible. I truly believe that this program or project will create many, many jobs and will get us back into the manufacturing game in a way that we have not been. I do not believe that we are not in manufactur-ing in Pennsylvania, but this will certainly enhance our economic capability here in the Commonwealth.
"
"Mr. President, I wish I could be as magnanimous
as my previous counterpart and suggest that I am not
going to be parochial. I am going to be parochial. While I am
concerned about the welfare of the Commonwealth with regard
to jobs, there are a number of refineries that constituents of mine
who have been there for generations are now finding themselves
unemployed. Sunoco and its decision to move on has had not just
a minor effect upon Marcus Hook or the southwest Philadelphia
community, but it had a major impact upon proud Philadelphians
and Delaware Countians who have, for their lifetimes, similar to
Senator Boscola's father, been employed in a particular way.
Generations had found fertile ground if they were not able to go
on to college and did not have the opportunity, were able to feed
their families and provide a stable background.
This new industry, which is arriving in waves, in titanic
waves to the shores of Pennsylvania, will find itself to southeastern
Pennsylvania for a while, which is said, what is the benefit
of this new industry? Well, literally, this tax credit is not just
about shale or a shale company, it is about the cracker industry
and what it can do for all of Pennsylvania. So while many people
line up to this mike in very familiar territory, I want people to
understand that those of us who argue at this mike for the least
of us are also going to be joined at this mike when it comes to
industrial outcome and a robust economy. It is not the government
which will put us back on our feet, it is the private sector,
and we have to embrace that. I received phone calls from all
parts of our community - union, private sector, those who are
unemployed, those who are employed, engineers, and high
schools - all having the hope that this industry will land in some
part of southeastern Pennsylvania and provide the same hope that
the Marcellus Shale wave has presented to western Pennsylvania.
I am delighted to see that there is an opportunity not just for
one segment of Pennsylvania, but for all of Pennsylvania. That
in fact we, like Oklahoma, can become the centerpiece of an
energy industry, which is what will prevent us from being so
dependent upon foreign shores across this country. So I hope that
today's vote will not just be a symbolic one, but in fact a new
start of how we collectively, bipartisanly, and creatively can
carve out an economy for all of Pennsylvania regardless of where
you live. So I too line up to support this particular piece of legislation.
Thank you, Mr. President."
"Mr. President, I also rise to lend my support
to House Bill No. 761, as we know is the Tax Code bill. Mr.
President, as some of my colleagues, and Senator Schwank in
particular, recognized and referenced that through this budget
process, there are a lot of other bills that are a major part of the
implementation of the budget, but also matters that must be addressed
before we take our summer recess that are very, very important to this Commonwealth outside of the General Appropriation
bill which we adopted earlier today. Mr. President, this
is very much one of those bills. There has been a lot of talk about
what we refer to as the cracker facility tax credit, the Shell tax
credit, and I do not want to lose sight of some of the other bills
that are parts and pieces of this Tax Code and I think are beneficial
to Pennsylvania.
Senator Schwank spoke about the inheritance tax issue and
the realty transfer tax issue with respect to agriculture and how
important they are. I know that Senator Blake has been working
on tax credit language that is encompassed in this bill. Senator
Ferlo has spoken about realty transfer tax to avoid a loophole that
is there, and the list can go on. There are a number of those types
of things contained in this bill that are very, very important to
allow us to go back into our communities and let our folks know
that we have been working to address these issues.
But as relates to the tax credit program, I am a supporter of
the concept and will be voting in the affirmative, as I stated. As
I see it, Mr. President, in this General Assembly and in this Commonwealth
and in our roles, and I have said it before, we have a
choice. We can stand up and make investments to try to facilitate
investments of others and by others in our regions, or we can sit
back and we can manage decline. In this particular case, we think
it is imperative that we work together with the industry that is
developing in the southwestern part of the State, and look at the
things that can be done with respect to the use of this tax credit.
A lot has been said about the downstream benefits, the subsequent
establishment and creation of industries in southwestern
Pennsylvania that we hope, and I strongly believe, will take place
as a result of the tax credit proposal, and the program that will
allow that to take place. But in order to make it work, we also
need to have upstream incentives, and that is exactly what is
going to take place, I think as Senator Mary Jo White referenced
earlier, how important it is to be able to use the resources that are
going to come out of the ground in southwestern Pennsylvania
and in a tri-State area, to be able to drive those resources to this
facility to allow the sustainability of the subsequent manufacturing
firms and industries that would be created there.
At the end of the day, this is going to create jobs, first and
foremost in the construction industry for the next several years,
talking about 5,000 to 6,000 to 10,000 jobs. In fact, it was reported
that we will have 10,000 people at a peak time working
on this facility. Let us stop and think about what that means,
10,000 people they say will be working on this facility getting it
ready. That is a pretty significant number of individuals who will
be employed from across our region, and that is something that
is a benefit to this. But the upstream and downstream benefits in
particular are something we need to look at. The number of jobs
created at the Shell facility in and of itself I think will be 400 to
500. Those will be good paying, family sustaining jobs. What I
imagine and what I heard are positions like chemists, chemical
engineers, mechanical engineers, and the like. But more importantly,
the secondary industries that will be created. They will
become -- our universities and our colleges and our apprentice
programs and the trade unions will become the feeder system to
be able to put folks to work in those industries and in this facility,
and that is what I am excited about.
So for a number of reasons that I have articulated, I stand here
to lend my support to a program that I believe will revitalize, and
as Senator White indicated, will be a global game changer for southwestern Pennsylvania and hopefully it will spread across
this wonderful and beautiful Commonwealth.
"
"Mr. President, let me be brief, which is not easy for me. I sat here and listened to this debate. I rose in opposition because I believe our industry in the southeast is re-ally being hurt - Bucks, Montgomery, Chester Counties. I will vote for this bill, after I listened to this debate, but I vote for it in the hope that my other southeastern Senators, under the leader-ship of Senator Pileggi, will rise to help this industry in the next year.
So when we come to this debate, hopefully western Pennsyl-vania will prosper by this, but hopefully we will, as a body, also unite in helping that industry in the southeastern part of the State, which is at the absolute core of our economic prosperity in the southeast. You know, whether I am talking Bucks County, Ches-ter County, Montgomery County, or the Lehigh Valley, a loss of this industry--and we are losing, if you look at the statistics, Pennsylvania is now one of the only seven States that is losing establishments and is losing employees in the United States. The rest of the United States is taking our companies from us, and this is hurting us. So I will support this bill. But again, I do so in the spirit and the hope, Mr. President, and you are from our re-gion as well, that together we will help our region.
Finally, let me say, I hope that this debate ends once and for all the rhetoric I sometimes hear from my Republican brothers and sisters to just let the free market economy work. Hey, listen, tax policy that Senator Mensch speaks about, what we are doing today, choosing winners and losers, is part of the global econ-omy, is part of the economics that is played both in the United States and globally. So let us end the rhetoric that somehow we just amazingly allow this free market economy to work, because that is not what we are doing today. We are choosing a winner and using our tax credits. I am not saying it is wrong, it is the way the economy works, but after this vote, it will be very unfair for my Republican colleagues to continue the rhetoric that it is an unabashed free market economy. But I will support this."
"Mr. President, I am glad to hear my colleague from the southeast and his pronouncement here right before me. I contemplated whether or not I would bring remarks to the floor, but I look at this as another opportunity to maybe ad-vance something that we can talk about and look at in the fall and maybe as time moves forward.
You have heard through the Tax Code bill all the different things that are going to be affected and the things that are going to be helpful from not only the cracker tax credit portion but the agricultural side of things, other business-related things, the film tax credit, agriculture, as well as some of the historical property and the things that will be benefitted by this Tax Code.
"
"Mr. President, while we as a legislative body have already agreed to bond over $4.5 billion to reduce the Federal UC debt that business would have had to pay and allow them to continue to receive their FUTA tax credits, we still consider reducing or eliminating the capital stock and franchise tax, and we are con-sidering a tax credit for Shell Chemical L.P. that could exempt them from much of its State tax burden for a quarter-century, up to $1.65 billion over 25 years, all in the name of jobs, with abso-lutely no guarantee of how many jobs or how well-paying those jobs would be. I suggest that it is time we do something for our constituents in the Commonwealth and pass the amendment to avoid more and more Pennsylvania folks falling into poverty.
To that point, Mr. President, I point out just a few items of interest with regard to raising the minimum wage:
The price of gasoline today is $1 per gallon more than it was last time when we voted to raise the minimum wage. Shell Oil Company made more than $7 billion in profit in the first quarter of this year due to those higher gas prices. Finally, in the 5 minutes it took me to make these remarks, Shell Oil made$300,000 in profit, while a minimum wage worker made 60 cents.
"
"The cracker plant in Beaver County, I supported that. Some of my colleagues supported
it. Tax credits, one of the largest tax credits in the history
of our Commonwealth, 15,000 new jobs. Do any of you know
how many will actually come from Pennsylvania? I do not. Will
they come from the corporate office, will they come from another
State? We have a responsibility to represent 12 million
 people."
"One of the main areas is along the line of tax credits that are
provided across the Commonwealth. The budget that was just
passed out of committee and came over from the House and
looks to be the foundation of what is going forward eliminates
those tax credits except for a couple, and one is the cracker facility
tax credit. Another one is the film tax credit, as well as the
EITC. All very, very good tax credit programs, and I supported
the cracker tax credit a couple of years back because I think it
will grow jobs. That makes sense, but what does not make sense
is when you strip out the other tax credits that help grow jobs.
They help us in our neighborhoods."
"I want to remind folks, I voted for the cracker plant
because I believe strongly in economic development. If there is
going to be a cracker plant and all it is hoped for, immediacy of
limited number of construction jobs during the build and
post-employment with ancillary companies that would develop
as a result of a cracker plant being located. If it is going to be 40
miles from Pittsburgh in Ohio, or 35 miles to West Virginia from
Pittsburgh, I would rather see it in Pennsylvania. So I voted for
that because consistently we Democrats and Republicans have
joined together to support appropriate economic development.
But to me, there is another big leap to support the inappropriate
practices of the industry. We need to strengthen our environment,
our health, and the quality of life that we expect for our constituents
and their respective communities. So, I do not see a contradiction
here, but we are losing sight of both our legislative and
our moral obligations to protect the public interest. We can have
this industry develop to some extent. I think we should greatly
control where and when and how it drills to a far greater extent
than Act 13 has allowed. "
"Mr. President, right now Pennsylvania
is the 10th-largest chemical-producing State in the nation.
However, we are positioned to become a world-class leader in
the petrochemical industry thanks to our abundant supply of
natural gas liquids, if we act now. A vital asset to our petrochemical
industries' continued growth is better access to the necessary
natural gas liquids. An ethane storage and distribution hub in
Pennsylvania would make all the difference. This would help our
State capitalize on its existing infrastructure and natural resources,
giving us an opportunity to create thousands of quality
jobs and drive business growth throughout the Commonwealth.
That is why I introduced this resolution which urges Congress to
take advantage of our unique position in the industry and enact
legislation to develop an ethane storage hub and distribution hub
in the Appalachian region.
My resolution encourages important Federal measures, which
are known as the Appalachian Ethane Storage Hub Study Act of
2017, Capitalizing the American Storage Potential Act, and the
Appalachian Energy and Manufacturing Revitalization Act. It is
projected that the Appalachian region contains enough natural
gas and liquid feedstock to attract $35 billion in new chemical
and plastics industry investment. Chemical and plastics industry
investments of this scale could create 100,000 new jobs, $28
billion in new economic output, more than $6 billion in annual
payroll, and nearly $3 billion a year in new Federal, State, and
local tax revenue. In order to fully capitalize on the opportunities
that are in front of us, we need to take strategic steps to insure
the responsible and sustainable development of our energy resources.
Shell's petrochemical facility in Beaver County is already
underway, and we should be doing everything in our
power to encourage more ethane companies to come here, stay
here, and create family-sustaining jobs.
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues for their support of this
important resolution."
"As the chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Industry,
I have spoken to numerous trade unions throughout the State and
have observed the partnership that exists between our trade
schools, unions, and energy employers. This is partnership that
insures these high-paying, skilled jobs are filled by our local
workforce. For example, let us take a look at Shell's ethane
cracker plant in Beaver County, which is one of the largest economic
investments to impact Pennsylvania since World War II.
This investment will utilize hundreds of local contractors and
suppliers, employ thousands of construction workers, and promise
to create numerous permanent positions upon completion of
the facility. However, as part of this partnership with the community,
Shell has a $1.5 million investment in local education and
training programs, such as the creation of new STEM labs to
insure students are equipped for the jobs of the future. Shell is
also to be commended for its commitment to help local veterans
by providing training for various positions that will be needed
within the new facility.
We must work together to avoid implementing unnecessary
roadblocks that would halt this industry's progress and instead focus our efforts on supporting a safe and reliable natural gas
infrastructure, workforce development initiatives, and job training
programs to strengthen our communities. In addition, as a
mother of two grown children whom I have raised in this community,
I can assure you that I take the safety and well-being of
my constituents very seriously. While I understand the need for
jobs and opportunities, I also support transparency and responsible
regulations. It is time we pursue commonsense policies and
not jeopardize local priorities, job growth, economic development,
and improved environmental outcomes for the sake of
political ideology.
"
"So, I rise in support of House Bill No. 761 for all the reasons that have been articulated on this floor in support of the bill. It will keep the energy here. There are a couple of important things I would also like to echo and share some of the commentary of Senator Mensch. It is not about me, it is about us. When the taxpayers sent $35 million to northeastern Pennsylvania to build a new medical college, I am not sure of the reaction of the people in Allentown, McKeesport, or Pittsburgh, but I can tell you we appreciated that investment. We are getting an enormous return on that investment, and we will continue to get a return on that investment."
"I had a chance to meet with Secretary Meuser and Secretary Walker about this project, trying to get to the bottom of the intention here. A couple of things strike me. First of all, the fiscal impact of this decision will have no budgetary impact on the Commonwealth before 2016 or 2017. It is a performance-based tax credit that will not have any fiscal impact on the budget until after perhaps a billion dollars' worth of investment has occurred and maybe 2,500 jobs are already created in constructing this plant. We are in competition with the world. We are in competi-tion with the nation. As my colleague Senator Baker said, we have a cluster of plastic manufacturers in northeast Pennsylvania who do ship their products from the Gulf. If we do not keep the energy here, it will go in pipelines to Ontario, Canada, or to the Gulf, where the infrastructure to deal with ethylene and plastic manufacturing and the resins that are produced will go, and with it will go the jobs, as well as the tax revenues."
"Again, it is not about me, it is about us. Economic growth, job growth, investments that generate tax revenue in Beaver County is every bit as meaningful as economic growth and job growth in northeast Pennsylvania for our General Fund. The labor commu-nity in southwest Pennsylvania has also come out in great sup-port of  this, and  I  think  that  is not insignificant. I  think that"
