"My opinion:  The Amazon Hub is an expensive boondoggle project that gives the appearance of having value but is a wasteful use of scarce financial resources.

"We currently have full-time staffing at all hours to receive packages, in an area that's under video surveillance. As long as the above is the case, I don't think the investment is justifiable."
"$34,000!!! I see no way to justify investing that amount of money for an Amazon Hub! Trish Boykin 508 "
I agree with the previous comments on this excessive investment!
"It seems like an excessive expenditure and a solution in search of a problem. If anyone goes to 2P and looks at the amount and size of packages, I think the value of our current arrangement will become even more obvious."
"The cost does seem excessive. I also am wondering if this is a solution in search of a problem. If one checks the boxes on 2P, one can also see the volume."
I’m surprised by the cost! I’d have expected it to be covered by Amazon. Our current system seems sufficient to me.
