"This proposal is something that I think could result in a large amount of savings over the long-term. I currently pay $89/month for my internet, which is so fast I could share simultaneous usage with 20 people and it would still be more than I need. That means, as an individual, I’m paying far too much for internet. If we were to instead treat it as a public good of the building, each resident would reduce their cost per month. This of course depends on how much a monthly fee for the building would be, and how many residents take advantage of this opportunity to collectively pay for services instead of doing so individually. "
"I get terrible service anywhere in the building with my carrier (Google Fi, which is a MVNO for T-Mobile). So having wifi outside of my unit would definitely be a perk. My biggest question is: how could we deliver free wifi throughout the common areas but gather payment from owners who want to use it in their private units? In other words, how do we avoid freeloading? We would also need a powerful internet connection to deliver sufficient bandwidth for the many many potential users at once. The old Greenlight Wifi provider we used to have was terribly slow, on par with DSL. I consume a lot of data and bandwidth each month through Fios, so I'm definitely not a candidate for using a shared Wifi. So overall for me, it would be more a convenience than anything to have public Wifi in the common areas"
$10K for installation of Wi-Fi in the building seems like an expensive experiment.  I’m think there are more important ways to spend the money.
"I wonder if there's a local provider that might entertain doing it for free (since the wiring is already in place), in return for the potential opportunity to sell their offering to unit owners. I do know that was the one advantage of Greenlight when they were here: they were much less expensive than Comcast. Otherwise, I'm inclined to agree with  Gerry though that given the costs facing us in 2023, it seems like a luxury."
"I think wifi connection in the basement or even through the building, like the elevators, should be worth considering. It really could be a good safety addition to the building as well. Currently my phone goes out of service when entering these areas and if someone were ever stuck in those areas and needed assistance, it would be impossible to reach somebody unless they were found. "
"I am against pursuing this project. It's unquestionably a luxury. And AT will have numerous essential, expensive items to address in the 2023 budget and beyond. Sorry for this tangent. This proposal touches on the idea of how residents view AT - is it a luxury condominium high-rise where current and future owners expect niceties such as whole-building wifi, 24/7 doorman, electric charging parking spots, etc.? In my opinion, no. AT was chosen because of its location and relative value. The most visible aspects of the building are old - carpets in halls and elevators, paint, building entry doors, antique electronic buzzer-entry system, party room, etc. And that's OK as long as it aligns with expectations and monthly fees. If I had wanted luxuries, I would have rented in one of the many modern high-rises constructed recently nearby - and paid dearly for it. Perhaps selfishly, I do not want potential buyers to be scared off by ever-escalating fees enacted to shine up an old building with an ever-increasing number of unexpected and expensive priorities."
"I agree with  Ahmed. The party room and general feel of the building is very old and dated. We did not manage to have patio furniture due to cost but we are entertaining spending $10K on WiFi. If we have extra $10K, I would prefer renovating party room kitchen over WiFi. "
"Just got an update today from a neighbor about the single elevators being stuck and they were caught in the elevator for 30 min unattended and trapped inside the elevator. They were suspended in between floors and thankfully had service to call Jim. This may be a separate issue, but it addresses the safety concern (along with being stuck in the garage) I touched upon that I believe in worth addressing. I think considering some areas with wifi should be thought over and don’t think this would qualify as a luxury but a safety net."
Is there not an alarm button in the elevator? I am not sure how can one be stuck/trapped in the garage when one can walk up to 1P and exit. Safety issues should not be relying on building wide WiFi in my opinion and it is not enough to justify the cost associated with this. 
"Maybe I don't understand WiFi, but how would that help in an emergency if your phone doesn't work? Are you saying you'd send someone an email to help out?"
"I think there is an alarm button and maybe wifi in the elevator isn’t possible because of the metal elevator shaft design. In addressing wifi, you can call through wifi as well besides sending an email. You could get stuck in the garage if there is a crash, blockade or fire. I understand it is unlikely, but wifi could be used versus just relying on the outside to call for help. In times of an emergency, I think being able to control something or adding another safety feature (doesn’t have to be added wifi) should be considered. Just thought this is something to raise awareness of."
"I agree with Ahmed's comments from yesterday regarding both the WiFi and the Hub.  These are high-end amenities that no one purchasing a unit at AT expects, and I'm sure they don't want to pay for them.  And quite honestly, after our Reserve Audit next week, I think we're going to find we can't afford such luxuries.  We have to finish the garage, we're going to need a new roof in the next few years--I for one don't want to be assessed out of living here, and I don't want my fee increasing 25% to help cover non-essentials."
"Do we not have an emergency button in the elevators? I thought we did, and that they connected to the guard on duty maybe?"
"Dear Unit Owners/Residents and Council, Let me touch on the various topics that have been raised as part of this discussion: Regarding the WIFI. Amberson Towers did at one time have an agreement with a local low cost internet provider. At that time, WIFI and those types of connections were just getting started and the building was used as a testing ground for development. The association has since terminated that relationship and instead uses Verizon for their internet communications for management. Given the other expensive needs that are coming up, WIFI might not be the best use of the funds, however I do believe it is something we should consider for the future. Regarding the incident in the elevator today. We believe it is due to a power flucuation, in fact as I am typing this message, our generator company is onsite to service the generator which has been running for most of the day. Duquesne Light has stated that there have not been any power issues in our area. The resident did safely get out of the elevator, our building supervisor, maintenance supervisor and myself were all doing our various parts. Our maintenance supervisor was actually outside the elevator where the resident was and stayed with them. I was also on the phone speaking with the resident, giving them updates on the situation. The elevator maintenance vendor was onsite, determined the issue to be power related, checked the elevators and returned everything to normal service. Regarding the elevator emergency call button. Yes, there is one. Once it is pressed, the call is immediately routed to either AT security and/or our after hours call center. Regarding other safety features. The garage has a panic alarm on all levels, it has been verified to work and I actually heard it this week as someone accidentally pressed it thinking it was a way to get into the building. Our physical plant also has a separate security system that is monitored 24/7 by Guardian Security. Council is considering upgrading our camera system and intercome panel. This all combined with having our own security department certainly assists with security and safety for the building. Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding these matters.
Thank you"
"It is clear that global WI-FI  offers wireless access in units and all common areas by a service provider who manages the deployment and operation of comprehensive Wi-Fi services for the property. Though, it is wise to wait for the  Reserve Study Report before we pursue any action towards this amenity/solution with the most reliable, cost effective, high-performing Wi-Fi provider. Considering the possibility of establishment of such service, I guess that we need to know: what the average resident is paying to their internet provider on a monthly basis, (including those that don't pay for Internet access) multiply that by the number of units (192 including the office) If the figure is less than the quoted monthly fee of global Wi-Fi provider, then we should follow through with it. Keeping in mind that it will be one-time fee of ~$53.00 for the initial installation ($10,000/192 units). A flat internet fee included in the monthly maintenance fee, so residents do not have to pay on individual basis. NOTE: my Verizon internet access is $76 on monthly basis. I think nowadays, most people think of internet access as more of a basic utility than a luxury. They want and expect reliable, high-performance Internet connectivity, fast service everywhere with a simple login and with proper security. Forward-thinking it will be a day that our building will have to adopt to a global WI-FI to as a value-added service that can be included as part of owners’ utilities rather than having to pay an internet provider on their own, just like we pay for water and electricity.
"
"Thinking of wifi as a public utility will make it more on par with the way we do gas, water, and electricity currently. This means we’ll have the same issues as we do currently with those where we have increased costs due to increased usage because there’s no financial penalty because it’s being absorbed by the other (more eco conscious) residents. I am opposed to public wifi. It also raises more security questions - residents connected to public networks for their private residences are now technically at risk if anyone on the public network opens a scam or phishing email or does any other risky behavior. We would HAVE to get cyber insurance at that point which is an additional cost. "
"I strongly agree with Katie on this. Moving additional resources in the building toward the shared utility model is the exact opposite direction we should be going. Internet access is something where you're going to have huge differences in values and opinions. People like me will demand a private internet connection at the fastest speed possible. Others will be content to have a shared, average or even below average connection, as long as it's affordable. There's no way to satisfy everyone by treating wifi as a utility."
That’s scary about the elevator getting stuck!  I wonder how often that happens here.
"Is there any data to indicate that the shared utility model leads to higher expenditure of resources compared to individual responsibility of each utility.
I strongly doubt that people in the building are being purposefully wasteful with resources because of the shared aspect of it. That said I agree wifi might be tricky due to security concerns and different expectations between Individual users.  Maybe there is a cheaper/easier way to bolster cell signals in the areas of the building with poor reception to improve communications during emergency situations, keeping in mind I know nothing about telecommunications and this might be something that exists or fiscally feasible.
