"I'll defer to your views but will say, I reviewed the materials and couldn't quite figure out what risk was being insured for us.  I didn't think we were users of a server that was linked to the net.  I know we can't even pay bills with ACH and am not aware of any personal financial information being held by the association.   The risk of having our fobs hacked seems a little over the top to me, so based on my very limited understanding of the issue, I'd hold off on the insurance till we complete some of the technological upgrades that are being considered."
"I don't think I understand why this would be necessary. There shouldn't be any financial information about owners anywhere, since all financial transaction would have been with a mortgage company; and our monthly payments are just checks from a bank account.  I'm not sure what kind of cyber-crime ATC might be in jeopardy of."
"Cyber threats aren’t going away, so our condo association  must be able to protect against data breaches of the whole system. We as owners, and the board members must be committed to staying vigilant and doing our  part so your association’s data stays safe.  We need to have a solid cyber security strategy and insurance to protect our cloud documents, financial records, administrative practices, personnel files, residents personal information,,etc. as the goal is to become paperless. The cyber insurance topics was brought up to the Finance committee on July 22 but no action has been taken to my knowledge. Also, the were two quotes submitted by our insurance agent with the following note: “The Chubb program ($504.00) is excellent and has all the same coverages as the attached AmTrust quote except one.  The AmTrust policy ($1,232.00) includes social engineering as a covered peril upfront, where as Chubb would require us to make a more thorough application to even receive pricing.   We can do that if you feel comfortable with the additional premium. It would likely be around the same price as the AmTrust policy."" I believe that we need to evaluate both quotes and determine the one that has a solid coverage including social engineering, computer fraud, and transfer funds even if the premium is higher. "
"The insurer should definitely be able to answer all these questions. But one of my clients is a local IT Managed Service Provider, so I might know enough to be dangerous here haha. I'd be very shocked if the policies cover residents. The bottom line is that every single individual and company is vulnerable to cyber attacks. A very high percentage of small businesses are the victim of some sort of cyber attack each year (different sources I've seen suggest it's probably 25-50%). Statistically speaking, it's likely we'll suffer from some sort of attack in the coming months and years. These policies can provide both first-party and third-party coverage (first-party covers our own costs of recovering from an attack; third-party covers us if we were sued by someone whose data was breached). The real question to me is, what data are we storing, and where? Is there anything sensitive? Will there ever be anything sensitive? If the answer is no, then it seems we're probably overinsuring, In any case, one thing we should do is begin requiring all computer users to complete end-user cybersecurity training. Even if we don't have secure data that's vulnerable, having users get a virus or ransomware will be a huge pain to recover from - especially since we don't have an IT resource.  "
"Aaron and David, thank you both for clearly addressing in my opinion the most salient points to this discussion about cyber-insurance. 1 - (David) - ""The Council is creating a backup of current and legacy records. These are uploaded to a cloud service and, I believe, to a local RAID drive. Do we already have sufficient protection for loss or records? To maintain the confidentiality of records?"" 2 - (Aaron) - ""The real question to me is, what data are we storing, and where? Is there anything sensitive? Will there ever be anything sensitive? If the answer is no, then it seems we're probably overinsuring."" In the case of AT, cyber-insurance may be a solution in need of a problem. If AT can avoid collecting and storing any sensitive information about residents, then that is the obvious (and cheapest) answer.  "
"Hey team, As I mentioned - I happen to have a client who's a well-known Pittsburgh IT Managed Services Provider, and I just had a meeting with them. I had their VP of Operations stay with me for a few minutes after the call to give me his opinion on this. He said that you have to know what you're storing and where you're storing it. For example, if it's only data about who lives in the building, etc., well, it's data that's already out there in the world (for example, you can find each resident's information through Allegheny County's Property Assessments website). It wouldn't be that damaging if such a document or system were accessed. His only concern would be if we store, or even have employees log into a third-party system, that contains credit card data / bank data / personal health data / etc. Unless we have a situation involving the latter, which I don't believe (but am not 100% certain) we do, his recommendation would be we don't need cybersecurity insurance."
"Meyers has a comprehensive cyber policy and recommends that Towers consider this for risk avoidance. It is not a high dollar amount and our trusted agent believes that it is in our best interest. Council could contact our solicitor or another attorney for an opinion if they wish. Given the ongoing tech developments that the association has already made and those that may come in the future, I believe this to be a wise move. As always it is up to the association."
"I appreciate that, but Meyers is also processing payments for individuals who rent for them and presumably have a lot more data exposed. See for example this page: https://meyersmanagement.residentport.com/payments As far as I understand, we do not have such an offering for owners, and Amberson employees do not have access to such financial information of owners or a third-party system that contains it. But as I mentioned, I'm also not 100% certain of this. The person whose advice I shared works with dozens of small businesses and non-profits in Pittsburgh to actively manage their cybersecurity, and partners with the insurers of these companies. I trust his expertise very strongly on this matter. I am a small business owner, and if he were advising my business, I would not personally seek further advice from outside legal counsel."
"I also reiterate that as a separate matter, I absolutely believe we do need to require cybersecurity training for all Association employees who may use a computer."
